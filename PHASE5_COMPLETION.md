## 🎯 Next Steps for Production Deployment

The project is now fully configured for production deployment. To deploy:

1. **Create Railway Project**
   ```bash
   railway login
   cd backend
   railway init
   # Add PostgreSQL and Redis services in dashboard
   ```

2. **Set Railway Environment Variables** (in dashboard)
   - Database and Redis URLs (auto-generated)
   - Pipedrive API token
   - Sentry DSN
   - JWT and webhook secrets

3. **Deploy Backend**
   ```bash
   railway up
   railway shell
   cd db && ./migrate.sh production
   ```

4. **Create Vercel Project**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   vercel login
   vercel --prod
   ```

5. **Set Vercel Environment Variables** (in dashboard)
   - API URL from Railway deployment
   - Pipedrive OAuth client ID
   - Redirect URI with Vercel URL

6. **Update Cross-References**
   - Set Railway FRONTEND_URL to Vercel URL
   - Update Pipedrive OAuth redirect URI
   - Configure GitHub Actions secrets

7. **Validate Production**
   - Test health endpoints
   - Verify OAuth flow
   - Test webhook processing
   - Confirm error tracking

## 🏆 Phase 5 Achievement

**Phase 5: Deployment - COMPLETE**

All deployment infrastructure is configured and validated. The Pipenotify integration is ready for production deployment to Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend) with full CI/CD automation.

The implementation follows Pipedrive Marketplace requirements and is optimized for first-submission approval.
