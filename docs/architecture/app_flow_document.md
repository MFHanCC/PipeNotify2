# Marketplace-Compliant App Flow Document - Pipedrive → Google Chat Integration

## Onboarding and OAuth Authentication Flow

### Marketplace Installation Process

When a user discovers the app in the Pipedrive Marketplace and clicks "Install App," they initiate a carefully orchestrated OAuth flow designed for seamless marketplace compliance:

**Step 1: OAuth Redirect Initiation**
The user is immediately redirected from the Pipedrive Marketplace to the app's OAuth authorization URL. This redirect includes essential parameters: the client ID registered with Pipedrive, a secure callback URI pointing to the app's authentication handler, a response type of "code" for the authorization code flow, and a state parameter containing a CSRF token for security validation. The URL structure follows Pipedrive's OAuth specification: `https://oauth.pipedrive.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/auth/callback&response_type=code&state=SECURE_CSRF_TOKEN`.

**Step 2: Pipedrive Native Authorization Screen**
Users encounter Pipedrive's familiar OAuth consent interface, which clearly lists the permissions being requested: read access to deals, activities, leads, people, and organizations; permission to create and manage webhook subscriptions; and access to basic company information. The consent screen maintains Pipedrive's branding and security messaging, ensuring users feel confident about granting permissions. Users can either click "Allow" to proceed with installation or "Deny" to cancel the process entirely.

**Step 3: Authorization Code Exchange**
Upon permission approval, Pipedrive redirects the user back to the app's registered callback URL with an authorization code and the original state parameter. The app's backend immediately validates the state token to prevent CSRF attacks, then exchanges the authorization code for access and refresh tokens via a secure POST request to Pipedrive's token endpoint. This exchange includes the client secret, which remains secure on the server side.

**Step 4: Tenant Creation and Welcome Redirect**
After successful token acquisition, the app creates a tenant record in the database, storing the encrypted tokens alongside company information retrieved from Pipedrive's API. The user is then redirected to the onboarding wizard, which opens within a Pipedrive Custom Modal to maintain the native Pipedrive experience.

### OAuth Error Recovery and Security

**Permission Denial Handling**: If users deny permission during the OAuth flow, they're redirected to a friendly error page that explains the necessity of the requested permissions for app functionality. The page includes a "Retry Installation" button that restarts the OAuth flow and provides links to support documentation.

**Security Token Validation**: All OAuth callbacks include comprehensive validation of the state parameter, authorization code format, and origin verification. Failed validations result in clear error messages and automatic security logging for monitoring potential attacks.

**Token Refresh Management**: The app implements automatic token refresh in the background, handling expired access tokens seamlessly without user intervention. If refresh token rotation occurs, the new tokens are immediately stored and encrypted in the database.

## Onboarding Wizard via Custom Modal

### Modal Architecture and User Experience

The onboarding wizard launches within a Pipedrive Custom Modal, ensuring users remain within their familiar Pipedrive environment throughout the setup process. The modal features a clean, step-by-step interface with progress indicators, breadcrumb navigation, and contextual help tooltips.

**Modal Step 1: Welcome and Account Verification**
The first modal screen welcomes users with a brief explanation of the integration's benefits and capabilities. The app automatically verifies the OAuth token by making a test call to the Pipedrive API, displaying the connected company name and confirming permissions. Users see their Pipedrive company logo and name, providing visual confirmation of the successful connection. A prominent "Continue Setup" button advances to the next step.

**Modal Step 2: Google Chat Workspace Configuration**
The second step focuses on connecting Google Chat workspaces. Users receive clear, illustrated instructions for generating Google Chat incoming webhook URLs, including screenshots of the Google Chat interface and step-by-step guidance. The interface provides input fields for a friendly space name (e.g., "Sales Team," "Deal Alerts") and the corresponding webhook URL. As soon as users paste a webhook URL, the app performs real-time validation by sending a test message containing "✅ Pipedrive integration test - Setup successful!" and displays immediate feedback with green checkmarks for successful connections or red error indicators with diagnostic information for failed attempts. An "Add Another Space" button allows configuration of multiple Chat rooms, with the ability to remove or edit previously added spaces.

**Modal Step 3: Notification Template Selection and Preview**
Users encounter a comprehensive template selection interface featuring a grid layout of available notification types. Each template card shows the event type (Deal Won, Deal Stage Changed, Activity Assigned, Activity Overdue, New Lead Created, New Person Added) with toggle options for Compact and Detailed message formats. A live preview panel on the right side of the modal displays actual notification appearances using sample data fetched from the user's Pipedrive account. The preview updates in real-time as users make selections, showing exactly how messages will appear in Google Chat. Template cards include brief descriptions of trigger conditions and sample message previews.

**Modal Step 4: Advanced Rule Configuration**
The rule configuration step presents collapsible panels for each selected event type, allowing detailed customization of notification criteria. Each panel includes filter options such as pipeline selection (populated with the user's actual Pipedrive pipelines), stage selection (dynamically updated based on chosen pipeline), deal owner selection (showing team member names and photos), and minimum deal value thresholds with currency formatting matching the user's Pipedrive settings. Below the filters, a dropdown menu assigns each rule to one of the previously configured Google Chat spaces. The preview panel continues to show live updates, demonstrating how filtering affects notification delivery. Users can expand or collapse panels as needed to maintain a clean interface.

**Modal Step 5: Testing and Activation**
The final step provides comprehensive testing capabilities before going live. Each configured rule displays with its own "Test" button and real-time status indicators. When users click "Test," the app generates simulated events matching the rule criteria and sends actual test messages to the designated Google Chat spaces. Status indicators show "Pending," "Success," or "Failed" states with detailed error messages for troubleshooting. Once all tests pass successfully, an "Activate All Rules" button becomes available. Activation triggers the creation of Pipedrive webhook subscriptions for the selected event types and enables all configured rules. Users receive confirmation of successful activation and are redirected to the main dashboard.

### Error Handling Within the Modal

**Validation Failures**: Each step includes inline error handling with specific, actionable error messages. Google Chat webhook validation failures display detailed diagnostic information, including HTTP status codes and suggestions for resolution. Permission errors during Pipedrive API calls show clear explanations and retry options.

**Network Connectivity Issues**: The modal gracefully handles network disruptions by displaying offline indicators and allowing users to retry failed operations. All form data remains preserved during connectivity issues to prevent data loss.

**Session Management**: OAuth token expiration during the onboarding process triggers automatic refresh attempts. If refresh fails, users see a notification explaining the need to re-authenticate, with a seamless path back to the OAuth flow.
